      <h3>About the website</h3>
      <p>I created this website to share what I have learnt with others online. I looked online, and I couldn't find any well designed, easy to learn tutorial websites out there. I try to make everything on here unique and I try to include things that are helpful that you may not have ever thought of before. I always try to make sure that anything that is written as a tutorial can be understood from the beginner level so that anyone is able to understand my tutorials.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>You can find out about me on my main website <a href="http://dylanturner.tech">here</a>. My main website has lots of other cool things on it, such as a list of tools I have created which is quite simular to this website except features games such as Mastermind and Hangman. If you want to play those, go to my website, click the tools button and then go to the games section where you will find a selection of games. If you want to find out about me personally, my other projects or read my blog you can go to my website and click the respective links in the menu.</p>
