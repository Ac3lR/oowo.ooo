      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h4>Keep It Civil</h4>
      <p>We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to <strong>criticize ideas, not people.</strong></p>
      <p>So, remember to avoid:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>name-calling</li>
        <li>personal attacks</li>
        <li>Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Comments that we find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated.</p>

      <p>I would add more to this, but I'm sure that you get the gist.</p>

      <h3>Website Updates</h3>
      <p>This space is for upcoming websites and scheduled maintenance. </p> 
      <p>Things to come (very soon)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixing up links to make sure they go to correct pages</li>
        <li>Make a logo for the menu (replacing the two Home links)</li>
        <li>Possibly create a forum where people can ask questions specific to the website.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I guess this brings us to the end of the help page. If you think that something is missing or should be added here please comment below.</p>
